This Visual Basic project consists of three forms. Additionally, it uses a dataset from the Starting out with the visual basic textbook. The idea behind the application is that the user can navigate from Form1 using the button payments or members. Clicking on either takes the user to either payments or members form, from where the user can create a new member, or simply look at all the payments. 

The dataset used enables the user to access queries on both forms which display all the members, all the payments, or payments over a particular sum.
